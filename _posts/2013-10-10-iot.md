# Architecture
<div style="display: table;width:900px;margin:0 auto; border:#FFFFFF 1px solid;" class="text001">
The AAEON HERO Device Management Center (DMC) is a dockerized web application which can be deployed on Linuxbased and Windows-based environments.<br>
Receiving information from HERO Agent and the HERO Gateway, HERO DMC provides a feature-rich web-based dashboard for managing devices, sensors and nodes connected to HERO Gateway as well
as managing the gateway itself. <br>
Utilizing M2M technology such as MQTT, HERO DMC allows users to monitor conditions live,
or set up event alerts sent out via email or messenger services to stay ahead of any situation. If you want to keep your data on your local storage device, HERO Device Management Center can also be deployed to your private cloud without problem.
